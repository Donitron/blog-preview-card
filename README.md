## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

Styling `<img>` elements is a pain. Learned that wrapping it in a `<div>` and using that to style it is way more predictable.

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <img src="assets/images/illustration-article.svg" alt="illutstration art" />
</div>
```

Also learned how to do hover animations.

### Continued development

Nothing coming to mind.
